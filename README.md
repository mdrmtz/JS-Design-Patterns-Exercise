# JS Design Patterns Exercise

type in the terminal:
`npm run jest` to run all tests.

Focus on these commonly used patterns:
1. Module/IIFE
2. Observer/PubSub
3. Prototype/Mixin
4. Singleton

## Goals

- Write code and organize it using the aforementioned patterns so that they satisfy the paradigms of encapsulation, organization, structure and reusability that are expected of each pattern.
- For every pattern the following criteria will be evaluated:
 - Context: A text description of real-world examples of where and under what circumstances this pattern is usually used.
 - Problem: A text description of what problems does this pattern help developers solve?
 - Solution: A text description of how do you plan to solve the required exercise for each pattern.
 - Implementation: A JS code file that shows your code solution.
- Show proficiency in the patterns by being able to explain each of the 4 code files either by using code comments or a verbal presentation.

### Extra points:

- [x] Include 1 to 3 other patterns of your liking.
- [x] Create unit tests for the code you write.
- [x] Include a README file with useful information about your exercises.
- [x] Publish your code on a public repo like Github, Bitbucket, etc OR in a JS code sandbox like JsFiddle, JSBin, etc.
